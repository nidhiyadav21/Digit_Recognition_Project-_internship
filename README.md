# Digit_Recognition_Project-_internship
Our project focuses on recognizing handwritten digits using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a deep learning model well-suited for image classification tasks. CNNs automatically learn spatial features such as edges, curves, and shapes from pixel data, enabling accurate digit recognition without manual feature extraction. We trained our model on the MNIST dataset, which includes thousands of labeled digit images, each sized 28Ã—28 pixels. The architecture consists of convolutional, pooling, and dense layers, ending with a softmax output to classify digits from 0 to 9. Once trained, the model was integrated into a Streamlit-based web application that allows users to either upload a digit image or draw one in real time. The system processes the input, predicts the digit, and displays the result instantly. This project highlights how machine learning and CNNs can replicate human-like pattern recognition and be applied in real-world scenarios like form processing and automation.
